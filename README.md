## Installation

You can install WPECS globally with the following command:

    make install

You will then be able to run WPECS from the any directory:

    USAGE: wpecs [--strict] [phpcs-options] <path>    
    <wpecs> Run the specified path against the WP Engine Coding Standards
    <wpecbf> Attempt to fix sniffs against the WP Engine Strict Coding Standards

    Try using 'wpecbf' to fix the sniff violations automatically.
